	<h1 id="about-us">About Us</h1>
	<p id="about-us-info">Hands-On STEM is a student-led 501(c)3 that strives to close the opportunity gap in the Bay Area.
		We organize STEM workshops for students in marginalized communities while raising awareness about educational inequities.
		<br>
<br>
<br>
Hands-On STEM was founded originally by  Trisha Sengupta in 2019, a junior in high school at the time.  She was inspired to act after seeing the inequities of educational opportunities among Bay Area's school districts as that lay foundation for future career choices.  Since then, Hand-On STEM grew by leaps and bounds and expanded to many members and programs.  Today we are 10 team members strong, with 15 mentors and 100 mentees.  </p>
